# Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects 
# based on different budget categories like food,
#  clothing, and entertainment. 
# These objects should allow for depositing and withdrawing 
# funds from each category, 
# as well computing category balances and transferring 
# balance amounts between categories‚Äù
